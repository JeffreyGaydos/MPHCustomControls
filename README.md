# Metroid Prime Hunters Custom Controls
Used in Conjunction with [MelonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/), allows users to play their legally ripped, backed-up ROM of Metroid Prime Hunters with as close to traditional FPS controls as possible.

WIP: Working on getting the AutoIT loops separated into separate, generated scripts so controls are as responsive as possible...

# Installation
Install AutoIt [here](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).
- Do note that since AutoIt has a lot of power over your computer, some actions it performs could trigger an antivirus alert

Download this repository in its entirety. There is a `.zip` on the releases page for ease of access.

# Execution
The batch script simply starts up an AutoIT config & calibration walkthrough and then runs the AutoIT scripts that are generated in the folder `Scripts`.

Have the game open with the touch controls visible, and make sure you are close to something scannable (if you want the scan controls).

# Piracy

Please do not pirate ROMs off the internet. At the very least, buy a physical copy of the game before you do. Be advised that downloading a ROM after buying a physical copy is still considered illegal in most US courts. Please be respectful of Nintendo's claims on the intellectual property of their fantastic games. Thanks!
